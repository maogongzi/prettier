#### Donâ€™t format nodes that end just before `rangeStart` (#9704 by @fisker)

Previously, when [range formatting](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#range) was performed, such nodes were considered part of the range, now they're excluded. This affects other languages that the range formatting feature supports, not only JavaScript.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
foo = 1.0000;bar = 1.0000;baz=1.0000;
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Range

// Prettier stable
foo = 1.0;
bar = 1.0;baz=1.0000;

// Prettier main
foo = 1.0000;bar = 1.0;baz=1.0000;
```
